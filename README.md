# Uwall

Ultra Wall by Nemesea - Add-on for Ben987's BondageClub game

A very simple mod to protect you from trolls abusing ULTRAbc commands with target.

Can be used without need to have also ULTRAbc.

It's a toggle command /uwall to enable or disable the protection.

By default, the protection is disabled.

When enabled, ULTRAbc will detect it when some commands are targetting you. 
The commands will not be executed and the command user will be informed about that.
No any change or message will be sent to the target screen.

Thanks to Sidsel for permission to use some BCE/FBC code!
